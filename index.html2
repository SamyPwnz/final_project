  <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3dx4u8jCbU8/hqdefault.jpg">
<p>The first Ford Mustang was a convertible model  with the VIN 5F08F100001. The car was used to be as a car to tour at Ford dealerships. But while it was at one of the Ford dealerships it waas accidently sold to a guy. The guy who bought it was a airplane pilot who kept it and drove for about 10,000 miles before giving it back to Ford. Ford was able to preserve that Mustang  after the customer returned it, and the vehicle is on display at the Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. </p>

<p>The Ford Mustang was almost not going to be named Mustang, it was going to be called the Ford Cougar. Early sketches show the Mustang model named as a Cougar, and there were a number of badges and emblems designed with the name as late as 1963. John Najjar, the original designer of the Mustang I Prototype, is said to have named the vehicle after the legendary P-51 Mustang fighter plane from World War II. Although this is the "official" story, many people believe the Mustang was named after the horse. Also in 1962 thier was a Mustang I concept car that was a two seater mid-engined 4-cylinder car.  </p>
